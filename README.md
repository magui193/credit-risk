# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

## Prediction of which model will perform better
### The most accurate model is going to be the Random Forest Classifier because it performs better when there is not much noise in the data.

## Unscaled Data

## Which model performed better? 
### For the unscaled data, the model that had a higher score was the Random Forest Classifier with a score of 61.8% compared to the Logistic Regression model score of 52.5%

## How does that compare to your prediction?
### As predicted, Random Forest Classifier had a higher score because the data does not have many noise in it, which makes this type of model to be the most accurate.

## Scaled Data

## How do the model scores compare to each other, and to the previous results on unscaled data? 
### After doing the scaled process with the data, the scores changed. The model with the highest score was Logistic Regression with 72% and the Random Forest Classifier had the similar score as before (61.9%). 
### Compared to the unscaled data, the score for the Logistic Regression increased almost 20 points and the Random Forest Classifier score increased only the 0.1 points.

## How does this compare to your prediction?
### This result shows that my prediction is correct because when the data is scaled it could create more noise in the data making more accurate the Logistic Regression model.
